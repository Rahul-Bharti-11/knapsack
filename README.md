Fractional Knapsack Problem (Greedy Algorithm) [C Implementation]
This repository contains a C program that solves the fractional knapsack problem using a greedy algorithm. The goal is to maximize the total value placed in a knapsack with limited capacity, allowing fractions of items to be included. Items are sorted by their value-to-weight ratio, and the program selects items or their fractions in order to achieve the optimal solution. Users can input the number of items, their weights and values, and the knapsack capacity to see the calculated maximum achievable value.
